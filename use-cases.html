  <h2>Practical AI use cases for nonprofits</h2>
  <p>
    Nonprofit organizations are often asked how they plan to use artificial intelligence,
    even when they operate with limited resources, high trust obligations, and little
    margin for error.
  </p>
  <p>
    This page outlines examples of how AI is beginning to show up in nonprofit work,
    along with the conditions that tend to make these uses helpful or risky. The goal
    is not to encourage adoption, but to support clearer thinking about where AI may
    reduce burden, where it may add risk, and where restraint is often the better choice.
  </p>
  <p><em>These examples are illustrative, not prescriptive.</em></p>
</section>

<section>
  <h2>How to read this page</h2>
  <p>Each use case is described along three dimensions:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Readiness</strong> — what skills, data, and governance need to exist first</li>
    <li><strong>Risk</strong> — who is affected if something goes wrong</li>
    <li><strong>Reversibility</strong> — how easy it is to correct mistakes or withdraw use</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    In practice, many challenges arise not from the technology itself, but from
    overestimating readiness, underestimating risk, or treating AI outputs as
    authoritative when they are not.

<!-- LOW-RISK USE CASES -->
<!-- ===================== -->

<section>
  <h2>Low-risk, internal use cases</h2>
  <p><em>Where most organizations should start, if anywhere.</em></p>

  <ol>

    <li>
      <h3>Internal document drafting and revision</h3>

      <p><strong>What it helps with</strong><br>
        Producing first drafts of internal documents such as memos, policies, agendas,
        or briefing notes that staff can then edit and refine.
      </p>

      <p><strong>Readiness considerations</strong><br>
        Clear ownership of final content, expectations that humans remain accountable,
        and shared guidance on tone and accuracy.
      </p>

      <p><strong>Risk considerations</strong><br>
        Outputs are frequently generic, overly confident, or misaligned with
        organizational tone if prompts and review processes are weak.
      </p>

      <p><strong>Reversibility considerations</strong><br>
        Drafts can be discarded or revised with minimal consequence, provided AI output
        is not treated as authoritative or final.
      </p>
    </li>

    <li>
      <h3>Summarizing long reports and research</h3>

      <p><strong>What it helps with</strong><br>
        Reducing the effort required to digest long reports, evaluations, or research
        papers by producing summaries, comparisons, or thematic extracts.
      </p>

      <p><strong>Readiness considerations</strong><br>
        Staff must understand the source material and be able to assess what has been
        omitted or simplified.
      </p>

      <p><strong>Risk considerations</strong><br>
        Important nuance can be lost, and summaries may reflect the model’s assumptions
        rather than the author’s intent.
      </p>

      <p><strong>Reversibility considerations</strong><br>
        Errors are usually recoverable if summaries are treated as aids to reading, not
        substitutes for engagement with the original material.
      </p>
    </li>

    <li>
      <h3>Grant application first drafts and reframing</h3>

      <p><strong>What it helps with</strong><br>
        Generating early drafts, alternative framings, or clearer explanations of
        programs and impact for grant applications.
      </p>

      <p><strong>Readiness considerations</strong><br>
        Strong internal clarity about mission and programs, and shared understanding of
        what funders are actually being asked to support.
      </p>

      <p><strong>Risk considerations</strong><br>
        Language can become formulaic or disconnected from real work if outputs are used
        without grounding or verification.
      </p>

      <p><strong>Reversibility considerations</strong><br>
        Low, as long as AI-generated language is revised and owned by staff before
        submission.
      </p>
    </li>

    <li>
      <h3>Internal knowledge access</h3>

      <p><strong>What it helps with</strong><br>
        Making internal documents easier for staff to navigate by answering questions
        based on existing policies or guidance.
      </p>

      <p><strong>Readiness considerations</strong><br>
        Up-to-date documentation, clear version control, and agreement on which sources
        are authoritative.
      </p>

      <p><strong>Risk considerations</strong><br>
        If source material is outdated or inconsistent, AI can confidently surface
        incorrect information.
      </p>

      <p><strong>Reversibility considerations</strong><br>
        Errors are correctable if outputs are monitored and staff know how to challenge
        or escalate issues.
      </p>
    </li>

    <li>
      <h3>Meeting preparation and recap support</h3>

      <p><strong>What it helps with</strong><br>
        Preparing agendas, outlining discussion points, or summarizing notes and action
        items after meetings.
      </p>

      <p><strong>Readiness considerations</strong><br>
        Clear understanding of meeting context, participants, and sensitivities.
      </p>

      <p><strong>Risk considerations</strong><br>
        Outputs can miss nuance, power dynamics, or unspoken concerns that matter in
        nonprofit environments.
      </p>

      <p><strong>Reversibility considerations</strong><br>
        High, as long as summaries are reviewed and not treated as definitive records.
      </p>
    </li>

    <li>
      <h3>Brainstorming and outlining</h3>

      <p><strong>What it helps with</strong><br>
        Generating options, questions, or outlines when teams are stuck or facing
        blank-page problems.
      </p>

      <p><strong>Readiness considerations</strong><br>
        Willingness to evaluate ideas critically and discard those that do not fit
        organizational reality.
      </p>

      <p><strong>Risk considerations</strong><br>
        Ideas may be superficial or overly optimistic without grounding in constraints.
      </p>

      <p><strong>Reversibility considerations</strong><br>
        Very high, provided outputs are treated as prompts for thinking rather than
        direction.
      </p>
    </li>
