      <h2>What I do</h2>
      <p>
        I help nonprofit organizations think clearly and responsibly about how
        artificial intelligence can support their mission without overwhelming
        their teams or compromising trust.
      </p>
      <p>
        This work often starts with governance and readiness, then moves toward
        low-lift, high-impact uses of existing tools, and only later into more
        advanced workflows when appropriate.

      <h2>About</h2>
      <p>
        I work at the intersection of product strategy, artificial intelligence,
        and organizational decision-making. My background includes building and
        advising technology products, and supporting mission-driven organizations
        that operate with limited capacity and high trust obligations.
      </p>
      <p>
        I focus on clarity, restraint, and practical judgment rather than
        technology for its own sake.
