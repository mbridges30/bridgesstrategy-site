  Clear, proportionate guidance for organizations navigating AI responsibly.

  <p>
    Many nonprofits feel pressure to “do something” with artificial intelligence,
    while also knowing that they operate with limited resources, high trust
    obligations, and little margin for error.
  </p>
  <p>
    I help organizations think clearly about where AI can genuinely reduce burden
    or increase impact, and where it should be approached cautiously or not at all.
    The goal is not adoption for its own sake, but better decisions.

  <h2>How I help</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Facilitated discussions with boards and leadership teams to assess AI readiness and risk</li>
    <li>Development of practical, values-aligned AI policies and guardrails</li>

  <h2>Examples and resources</h2>

  <p>
    For organizations that find it helpful to see how this thinking translates
    into practice, I have put together a small number of illustrative tools.
  </p>

  <h3>AI readiness conversation</h3>
  <p>
    A structured conversation to help leadership teams reflect on readiness,
    governance, and practical next steps before deciding whether to move forward.
  </p>

  </p>

  <h3>Nonprofit AI policy builder</h3>
  <p>
    A guided drafting tool designed to help nonprofits think through the elements
    of an internal AI policy, including scope, responsibilities, and guardrails.
  </p>
  <p>
    This is not a legal template or a one-click solution, but a starting point for
    discussion and review within an organization.

  <h2>What this work is not</h2>
  <p>
    This is not a software sales process, a push toward automation at all costs,
    or a belief that AI is a solution to structural or funding challenges.
  </p>
  <p>
    In many cases, the right outcome is deciding to move slowly, limit use to
    internal workflows, or postpone adoption entirely until conditions are right.
  </p>

  <h2>About</h2>
  <p>
    I work at the intersection of product strategy, artificial intelligence, and
    organizational decision-making. My background includes building and advising
    technology products, as well as supporting mission-driven organizations that
    operate with limited capacity and heightened responsibility to the people
    they serve.
  </p>
  <p>
    My approach emphasizes clarity, proportionality, and trust over speed or
    technical novelty.
  </p>

  <h2>Next step</h2>
  <p>
    If you want a clear, grounded conversation about AI readiness and implications
    in your organization, you are welcome to reach out.
